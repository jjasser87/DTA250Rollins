# ============================
# 1. Creating Vectors
# ============================

# 1a. Create a numeric vector with the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.
# Print the vector.

# 1b. Create a character vector with at least 5 fruit names.
# Print the vector.

# 1c. Create a logical vector with 6 elements (mix of TRUE and FALSE).
# Print the vector.

# 1d. Use the : operator to create a sequence from -3 to 3.
# Print the sequence.


# ============================
# 2. Arithmetic with Vectors
# ============================

# 2a. Create two numeric vectors of length 5 each.
# Add them together and print the result.

# 2b. Subtract the second vector from the first and print the result.

# 2c. Multiply the two vectors element-wise and print the result.

# 2d. Divide the first vector by the second and print the result.


# ============================
# 3. Comparisons and Logic
# ============================

# 3a. Create a vector of numbers 1 through 10.
# Use a comparison operator to find which numbers are greater than 5.

# 3b. Check if ALL numbers in the vector are greater than 0 (hint: all()).

# 3c. Check if ANY number in the vector is equal to 7 (hint: any()).


# ============================
# 4. Accessing Elements
# ============================

# 4a. Create a vector with values from 10 to 20.
# Access the 3rd element only.

# 4b. Access the 2nd through 5th elements (use a sequence inside []).

# 4c. Access only the elements greater than 15 (use logical indexing).


# ============================
# 5. Factor Vectors
# ============================

# 5a. Create a character vector with student class levels:
# "freshman", "sophomore", "junior", "senior" (include repeats).

# 5b. Convert the character vector to a factor.

# 5c. Print the levels of the factor.

# 5d. Reorder the levels so they appear in the order:
# freshman, sophomore, junior, senior.

# 5e. Convert the factor to numeric values and print them.
