# ============================
# 1. Matrices
# ============================

# 1a. Create a matrix from numbers 1 through 9 with 3 rows and 3 columns.
# Print the matrix.

# 1b. Create the same matrix but fill it by row instead of by column.
# Print the matrix.

# 1c. Access the element in the 2nd row and 3rd column.

# 1d. Extract the entire first row.

# 1e. Extract the entire second column.

# 1f. Add two 2x2 matrices together. Print the result.

# 1g. Multiply two 2x2 matrices using element-wise multiplication (*).
# Print the result.

# 1h. Multiply two 2x2 matrices using matrix multiplication (%*%).
# Print the result.

# 1i. Create a transpose of a 3x3 matrix (hint: t()).
# Print the result.

# 1j. Multiply a matrix by a vector using %*%. Print the result.


# ============================
# 2. Lists
# ============================

# 2a. Create a list containing:
# - a numeric vector (1:5)
# - a character vector (names of 3 cities)
# - a logical vector (mix of TRUE/FALSE values)

# 2b. Print the entire list.

# 2c. Access only the numeric vector from the list.

# 2d. Access the second element of the character vector inside the list.

# 2e. Add a new element to the list: a matrix with numbers 1–4 in 2 rows, 2 columns.

# 2f. Rename the list elements as: numbers, cities, flags, matrix.

# 2g. Access the matrix element by its name.

# 2h. Replace the "flags" element in the list with a new logical vector of length 3.


# ============================
# 3. Arrays
# ============================

# 3a. Create a 3-dimensional array with numbers 1–24, 
#     dimensions = (3 rows, 4 columns, 2 "tables").
# Print the array.

# 3b. Access the element in row 2, column 3, table 1.

# 3c. Extract the entire 2nd row of the first table.

# 3d. Extract the entire 3rd column across all tables.

# 3e. Add 5 to every element in the array (vectorized operation).
