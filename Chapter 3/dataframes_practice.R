# 1. Creating Data Frames
# ============================

# 1a. Create a data frame with the following columns:
# - Name (3 student names as characters)
# - Age (their ages as numbers)
# - Major (their majors as characters)
# Print the data frame.

# 1b. Use the str() function to check the structure of your data frame.

# 1c. Use the summary() function to get summary statistics of your data frame.


# ============================
# 2. Accessing and Subsetting
# ============================

# 2a. Access the "Name" column using the $ operator.

# 2b. Access the second row of the data frame.

# 2c. Access the Age of the first student (row 1, column 2).

# 2d. Access rows 1 and 3, but only the Name and Major columns.

# 2e. Use logical indexing to select all students with Age > 20.


# ============================
# 3. Useful Functions
# ============================

# 4a. Use head() to view the first rows of the dataset.

# 4b. Use tail() to view the last rows of dataset.

# 4c. Use summary() on dataset.

# 4d. Use str() on dataset.
