# Question 1 (Easy)
# Write a function that takes in a number and returns "even" if the number is 
# even and "odd" if the number is odd.

# Question 2 (Medium)
# Write a function that takes in a number and returns "positive" if the number
# is positive, "negative" if the number is negative, and "zero" if the number
# is zero.
# What if you provide a character or a logical value to the function?
# You need to make sure that the class of the input is numeric.
# Use the class() function to check the class of the input.

# Question 3 (Medium)
# Write a function that takes in a vector. Find the average of that vector and
# print a letter grade based on the average.
# >= 90 is A. >= 80 is B. >= 70 is C. >= 60 is D. Else is F

# Question 4 (Hard)
# Write a function that takes two numbers, x and y, and returns
# "positive and between 1 and 10" if the sum of the two numbers is positive and
# between 1 and 10, "positive and greater than 10" if the sum is positive and
# greater than 10, "negative and between -10 and -1" if the sum is negative
# and between -10 and -1, "negative and less than -10" if the sum is negative
# and less than -10, and "zero" if the sum is zero.
# You can solve this either using nested if-else statements or using logical
# operators.
# You also need to make sure that the class of the inputs is numeric.
